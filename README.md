1. Project Folder Structure Setup
Create the main project directory.
Inside the project directory, create subdirectories for the backend (/server) and frontend (/client).
Initialize Node.js in the backend with npm init -y and create necessary files and folders (controllers, models, routes, middleware).
Set up the frontend with a framework like React using npx create-react-app client.
2. Initial Routes & Controllers Setup
In the backend, create initial routes for basic functionalities in the /routes folder.
Create corresponding controller files in the /controllers folder to handle the logic for each route.
Set up basic route handling in your server entry point (e.g., server.js or app.js) using Express.
3. User Model
Define a User model in the /models folder using a schema definition library like Mongoose for MongoDB or Sequelize for SQL databases.
Include necessary fields like name, email, password, etc.
4. Auth Controller Logic Part 1
Create authentication controllers to handle user registration and login.
Implement logic for hashing passwords using a library like bcrypt.
Validate user inputs and handle responses appropriately.
5. Custom Error Handling Middleware
Create a custom error handling middleware in the /middleware folder.
Define error classes for common errors (e.g., AppError).
Use this middleware in your Express app to catch and handle errors consistently.
6. Generating JWT and Creating Protect Middleware
Implement JWT generation in your auth controllers using a library like jsonwebtoken.
Create middleware to protect routes by verifying JWTs.
Apply the protect middleware to sensitive routes.
7. Setting Up Emailing
Configure email sending functionality using a service like SendGrid or Nodemailer.
Create a utility for sending emails and integrate it into your auth controllers for actions like sending verification emails or password resets.
8. Setting Up Routing
In the frontend, set up routing using react-router-dom.
Create routes for different pages/components like Home, Login, Register, Dashboard, etc.
Implement navigation between these routes.
9. Creating Private Route
Create a PrivateRoute component in the frontend to restrict access to certain routes based on authentication.
Use the Navigate component from react-router-dom v6 to redirect unauthenticated users.
10. Finishing Frontend Build
Complete the frontend by implementing all necessary components and integrating with the backend API.
Ensure proper state management (e.g., using Context API, Redux).
Style the application using CSS, SCSS, or a styling library.

Fix any bugs and optimize performance.
Prepare a final demo showcasing all features, from user registration and login to protected routes and email functionalities.
